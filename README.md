Tracer is a 2-DOF Spherical Parallel Manipulator designed for drawing user input on a 2D plane. It uses a 3D-printed spherical mechanism to achieve precise movement in two degrees of freedom, allowing it to trace out complex shapes and patterns. The manipulator is controlled via a web interface, enabling users to input their desired shapes and see them drawn in real-time. This project is my mechanical engineering graduation project, showcasing my skills in mechanical design, control systems, inverse kinematics, and web development.
